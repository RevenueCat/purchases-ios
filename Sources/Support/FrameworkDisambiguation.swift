/**
 Purpose: this file is needed because several parts of the SDK need to explicitily reference a type or value
 from the `RevenueCat` target. However, we expose 2 variants of the framework from SPM:
 `RevenueCat` and `RevenueCat_CustomEntitlementComputation` (see `Package.swift`).
  Because of that, we can't simply do `RevenueCat.ErrorCode` for example, since the other variant
  would need `RevenueCat_CustomEntitlementComputation.ErrorCode`.

  To handle that, this exposes those types explicitly so they work regardless of the name of the framework.
