//  Created by Nacho Soto on 2/10/23.

import Foundation

/// The result of data verification process.
///
/// This is accomplished by preventing MiTM attacks between the SDK and the RevenueCat server.
/// With verification enabled, the SDK ensures that the response created by the server was not
/// modified by a third-party, and the entitlements received are exactly what was sent.
/// 
/// - Note: Entitlements are only verified if enabled using
/// ``Configuration/Builder/with(entitlementVerificationMode:)``, which is disabled by default.
///
/// ### Example:
/// ```swift
/// let purchases = Purchases.configure(
///   with: Configuration
///     .builder(withAPIKey: "")
///     .with(entitlementVerificationMode: .informational)
/// )
///
/// let customerInfo = try await purchases.customerInfo()
/// if !customerInfo.entitlements.verification.isVerified {
///   print("Entitlements could not be verified")
/// }
/// ```
