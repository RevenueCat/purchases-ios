      # Note: actions based on issue comments always trigger from the main branch. So we need to tell CircleCI to use a specific branch. 
      # We can do that by passing in the target-branch. 
      # This solution is based on this comment: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/trigger-circleci-pipeline-action/issues/61#issuecomment-1662021882
      # But we can also see that the following code reads from this parameter: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/trigger-circleci-pipeline-action/blob/a81cd720792a6088debd7f182b552845abb86f1b/src/lib/CircleCIPipelineTrigger.ts#L66
      # Even though it seems to be undocumented as of writing.

      # Note 2: this assumes that the github client is installed
      # As of writing, this is installed in ubuntu-latest
