## Common project specific issues

There are certain project specific issues that are commonly misinterpreted as bugs.

- [Offerings, products, or available packages are empty](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041793174)
- [Invalid Play Store credentials errors](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046398913)
- [Unable to connect to the App Store (STORE_PROBLEM) errors](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046399333)

For support I'd recommend our [online community](https://spectrum.chat/revenuecat), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/revenuecat/) and/or [Help Center](https://support.revenuecat.com/hc/en-us) 👍

If you have a clearly defined bug (with a [Minimal, Complete, and Reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)) that is not specific to your project, follow the steps below to file it with RevenueCat. For SDK-related bugs, make sure they can be reproduced on a physical device, not a simulator (there are simulator-specific problems that prevent purchases from working).

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. The more detail you can provide the faster our team will be able to triage and resolve the issue.
