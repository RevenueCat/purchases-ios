## Setup & Run

### Prerequisites
- Be sure to have an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
    - You must join the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) to create In-App Purchases.
    - You must sign the [Paid Applications Agreement](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started#3-store-setup) and complete your [bank/tax information](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started#3-store-setup) to test In-App Purchases.
- Be sure to set up a [Sandbox Tester Account](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev8b997bee1) for testing purposes.
- Add your [App-Specific Shared Secret](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret) to RevenueCat. If you don't have a RevenueCat account yet, sign up for free [here](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup).
- Be sure to set up at least one subscription on the App Store and link it to RevenueCat:
    - Add the [product](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#products) (e.g. `rc_3999_1y`) to RevenueCat's dashboard. It should match the product ID on the App Store.
    - Attach the product to an [entitlement](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#creating-an-entitlement), e.g. `premium`.
    - Attach the product to a [package](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#adding-packages) (e.g. `Annual`) inside an [offering](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements#creating-an-offering) (e.g. `sale` or `default`).
- If you're testing on a simulator instead of a physical device, be sure to set up your [StoreKit configuration files](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/apple-app-store#ios-14-only-testing-on-the-simulator).
- Get your [API key](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/authentication#obtaining-api-keys) from your RevenueCat project.

### Steps to Run
1. Open the file `Magic Weather SwiftUI.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
2. On the **General** tab of the project editor, match the bundle ID to your bundle ID in App Store Connect and RevenueCat.
