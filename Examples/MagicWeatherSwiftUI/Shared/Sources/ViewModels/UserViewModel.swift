         `reset` clears the cache and regenerates a new anonymous user ID.
         
         Note: Each time you call `reset`, a new installation will be logged in the RevenueCat dashboard as that metric tracks unique user ID's that are in-use. Since this method generates a new anonymous ID, it counts as a new user ID in-use.
