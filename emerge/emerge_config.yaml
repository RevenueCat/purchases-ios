# Gets around an issue that was causing StoreKit previews to be included when running in Catalyst mode.
# Should be fixed in EmergeTools v0.10.23+, and this won't be necessary anymore.
# This exclusion only runs on EmergeTool's server. When running locally, the same exclusion is applied,
# via the snapshotPreviews() method in PaywallsTesterTests.swift
