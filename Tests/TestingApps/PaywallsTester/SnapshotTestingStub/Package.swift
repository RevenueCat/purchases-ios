    //
    // At the time of the writing, we still support iOS 13 and iOS 14, which need macOS 12 to run tests in the simulator.
    // CircleCI bundles Xcode 14.2 with the macOS 12 image, which comes with Swift 5.7.
    // Emerge's SnapshotPreviews package currently has a dependency on the https://github.com/swhitty/FlyingFox package version 0.16 which requires Swift 5.8.
    // When we open Revenuecat.xcodeproj in Xcode 14.2, it tries to pull all dependencies, including SnapshotPreviews, and fails to build because of the FlyingFox dependency.
    // This prevents us from running tests in the iOS 13 and iOS 14 simulators.
    // It is not possible to add a package to an Xcode project conditionally on the Swift version used, but we can create a stub package that only depends on SnapshotPreviews,
    // and only pulls the dependency for Swift 5.8.
