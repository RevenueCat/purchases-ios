## 4.0.0

RevenueCat iOS SDK v4 is here!! 

![Dancing cats](https://media.giphy.com/media/lkbNG2zqzHZUA/giphy.gif)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-ios/compare/main...4.0.0)

### Migration Guide
- See our [RevenueCat V4 API update doc](Documentation.docc/V4_API_Migration_guide.md) for API updates.
**Note:** This release is based off of 4.0.0-rc.4. Developers migrating from that version shouldn't see any changes. 

### API changes:
There have been a lot of changes since v3! 

Here are the highlights:

#### Async / Await alternative APIs
New `async / await` alternatives for all APIs that have completion blocks, as well as an `AsyncStream` for CustomerInfo. 

#### New types and cleaned up naming
New types that wrap StoreKit's native types, and we cleaned up the naming of other types and methods for a more consistent experience. 

#### New APIs for Customer Support
You can now use `showManageSubscriptions()` and `beginRefundRequest()` to help your users manage their subscriptions right from the app.

#### Rewritten in Swift 
We [rewrote the SDK in 100% Swift](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/migrating-our-objective-c-sdk-to-swift). This made the code more uniform and easy to maintain, and helps us better support StoreKit 2. 

#### StoreKit 2 Support [Beta]
**[Experimental]** Introduced support for using StoreKit 2 under the hood for compatible devices. This is currently in beta phase, and disabled by default. 
When enabled, StoreKit 2 APIs will be used under the hood for purchases in compatible devices. You can enable this by configuring the SDK passing `useStoreKit2IfAvailable: true`. 
On devices that don't support StoreKit 2, StoreKit 1 will be used automatically instead. 
 
#### Full API changes list
- See our [RevenueCat V4 API update doc](Documentation.docc/V4_API_Migration_guide.md) for API updates.

### Documentation: 

We built a new Documentation site with Docc with cleaner and more detailed docs. 
The new documentation can be found [here](https://revenuecat-docs.netlify.app/documentation/Revenuecat).

### Changes from previous RC

These changes add to all of the changes from beta RC 1, [listed here.](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/blob/4.0.0-rc.1/CHANGELOG.latest.md).


## 4.0.0-RC.1

- First RC for RevenueCat framework v4 🎉
    100% Swift framework + ObjC support.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-ios/compare/4.0.0-beta.10...4.0.0-rc.1)

RC 1 introduces the following updates:

### API changes:

- `Purchases.paymentDiscount(forProductDiscount:product:completion:)` and `Purchases.paymentDiscount(forProductDiscount:product:)` have been removed. Now, instead of obtaining the `SKPaymentDiscount` from a `SKProductDiscount` to then call `purchase(package:discount:)`, you check eligibility for the promo offer by calling `checkPromotionalDiscountEligibility(forProductDiscount:product:)`, then get the `StoreProductDiscount` directly from the `StoreProduct` and pass that into `purchase(package:discount:)`. 

- `StoreProduct` and `StoreProductDiscount`, replace `SKProduct` and `SKProductDiscount` in the following methods:
    - `Purchases.getProducts(_:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.products(_:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(product:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(product:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(product:discount:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(product:discount:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(package:discount:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(package:discount:)`
    - `PurchasesDelegate.purchases(shouldPurchasePromoProduct:defermentBlock:)`
- `StoreProduct.introductoryPrice` has been renamed to `StoreProduct.introductoryDiscount`
- `StoreTransaction` now includes `quantity`
- Renamed `Purchases.restoreTransactions` to `Purchases.restorePurchases`
- Lowered `StoreProduct.introductoryDiscount` availability to iOS 11.2 and equivalent OS versions
- Added several `@available` annotations for automatic migration from StoreKit types

In addition to all of the changes from beta 10, [listed here.](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/blob/4.0.0-beta.10/CHANGELOG.latest.md)


### Other changes: 
- There are lots of under the hood improvements. If you see any issues we'd appreciate [bug reports](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)!


## 4.0.0-beta.10

- Tenth beta for RevenueCat framework 🎉
    100% Swift framework + ObjC support.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-ios/compare/4.0.0-beta.9...4.0.0-beta.10)
- See our [RevenueCat V4 API update doc](Documentation.docc/V4_API_Migration_guide.md) for API updates.

Beta 10 introduces the following updates:

### Breaking changes:
- A new type, `StoreTransaction`, replaces `SKPaymentTransaction` in the return types of the following methods:
    - `Purchases.purchase(product:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(package:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(package:discount:completion:)`
    - `Purchases.purchase(package:discount:completion:)`
    - `PurchasesDelegate.purchases(shouldPurchasePromoProduct:defermentBlock:)`
    - `CustomerInfo.nonSubscriptionTransactions`
- `StoreProduct.PromotionalOffer` has been renamed to `StoreProduct.StoreProductDiscount`.

In addition to all of the changes from Beta 9, [listed here.](
https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/blob/4.0.0-beta.9/CHANGELOG.latest.md)


### Other changes: 
- There are lots of under the hood improvements. If you see any issues we'd appreciate [bug reports](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)!

## 4.0.0-beta.9

- Ninth beta for RevenueCat framework 🎉
    100% Swift framework + ObjC support.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/revenuecat/purchases-ios/compare/4.0.0-beta.8...4.0.0-beta.9)
- See our [RevenueCat V4 API update doc](docs/V4_API_Updates.md) for API updates.

### Breaking changes:
- `identify`, previously deprecated, has been removed in favor of `logIn`.
- `reset`, previously deprecated, has been removed in favor of `logOut`.
- `Package.product` has been replaced with `Package.storeProduct`. This is an abstraction of StoreKit 1's `SKProduct` and StoreKit 2's `StoreKit.Product`, but it also adds useful features like `pricePerMonth` and `priceFormatter`. The underlying objects from StoreKit are available through `StoreProduct.sk1Product` and `StoreProduct.sk2Product`.

### Xcode version requirements and updated deployment targets
`purchases-ios` v4 requires using Xcode 13.2 or newer. 
It also updates the minimum deployment targets for iOS, macOS and tvOS. 

##### Minimum deployment targets
|  | v3 | v4 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| iOS | 9.0 | 11.0 |
| tvOS | 9.0 | 11.0 |
| macOS | 10.12 | 10.13 |
| watchOS | 6.2 | 6.2 (unchanged) |

### StoreKit 2 support:
- This beta introduces new methods that add functionality using StoreKit 2:
    - `showManageSuscriptions(completion:)`
    - `beginRefundRequest(forProduct:)`
    - `beginRefundRequest(forEntitlement:)`. 
    - `beginRefundRequestForActiveEntitlement()`
 - `checkTrialOrIntroductoryPriceEligibility(productIdentifiers:completion:)` now uses StoreKit 2 if it's available, to make calculation more accurate and fast.
 - A new flag has been introduced to `setup`, `useStoreKit2IfAvailable` (defaults to `false`), to use StoreKit 2 APIs for purchases instead of StoreKit 1.

### `Async` / `Await` alternative APIs
- In purchases-ios v3, `Async` / `Await` alternative APIs were made available through Xcode's auto-generation for Objective-C projects. This beta re-adds the `Async` / `Await` alternative APIs for v4.

### New APIs:

- `showManageSuscriptions(completion:)`: Use this method to show the subscription management for the current user. Depending on where they made the purchase and their OS version, this might take them to the `managementURL`, or open the iOS Subscription Management page. 
- `beginRefundRequestForCurrentEntitlement`: Use this method to begin a refund request for the purchase that granted the current entitlement.
- `beginRefundRequest(forProduct:)`: Use this method to begin a refund request for a purchase, specifying the product identifier.
- `beginRefundRequest(forEntitlement:)`: Use this method to begin a refund request for a purchase, specifying the entitlement identifier.
- Adds an optional `useStoreKit2IfAvailable` parameter to `setup` (defaults to `false`). If enabled, purchases will be done by using StoreKit 2 APIs instead of StoreKit 1. **This is currently experimental, and not all features are supported with StoreKit 2 APIs**.
- Use `verboseLogHandler` or `verboseLogs` to enable more details in logs, including file names, line numbers and method names.

### Known issues:
- Promotional offers and deferred purchases are not currently supported with StoreKit 2. If your app uses either of those, you should omit `useStoreKit2IfAvailable` in `setup` or set it to `false`.

### Other changes: 
- There are lots of under the hood improvements. If you see any issues we'd appreciate [bug reports](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)!

## 3.1.1
- small fixes to docs and release scripts: 
    - the release script was referencing a fastlane lane that was under the group ios, 
    so it needs to be called with ios first
