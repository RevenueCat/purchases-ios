### StoreKit 2 Beta

This beta introduces a new configuration option to enable full StoreKit 2 flow on the SDK and the RevenueCat backend.

We have been testing StoreKit 2 support in parallel to StoreKit 1 in our backend for a while and we believe it is ready for widespread use.

If your app is currently using StoreKit 1, it is safe to update to StoreKit 2 and it's even possible to switch back to StoreKit 1 if needed. Switching to StoreKit 2 will not prevent purchases made with StoreKit 1 from being processed.

In order to enable StoreKit 2, add `.with(storeKitVersion: .storeKit2)` to your RevenueCat configuration code:

```
Purchases.configure(with: .builder(withAPIKey: apiKey)
    .with(storeKitVersion: .storeKit2)
    .build()
```

If you were previously using the deprecated configuration option `.with(usesStoreKit2IfAvailable: true)`, we recommend you remove it and switch to the new supported method.

In order to validate StoreKit 2 purchases, make sure you have an In-App Purchase Key configured in your app.
