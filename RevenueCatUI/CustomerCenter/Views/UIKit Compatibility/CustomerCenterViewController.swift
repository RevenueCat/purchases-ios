/// Use the Customer Center in your app to help your customers manage common support tasks.
///
/// Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help
/// your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent
/// churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with
/// exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all
/// without any help from your support team.
///
/// The `CustomerCenterViewController` can be used to integrate the Customer Center directly in your app with UIKit.
///
/// For more information, see the [Customer Center docs](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/customer-center).
